## Human

### Soft but versatile invaders.

Humans, sometimes archaically referred to as Man, are a prolific, versatile people, the very species which gave rise to the term 'humanoid'.

Originating from the taigas of Lightningshield, the Sacrilites are a hardy and cunning people, with thick, furry body hair.
