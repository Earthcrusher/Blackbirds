## The War of Gorgons
A tremendous, world-spanning war that marked the end of the Fae Age, named for the desert on which it was fought. It is singular in that almost nothing of Man's history survived the battle - the names of the nations, their people, their culture, and most of their technology was lost.

### Survival of Synthetics
Scholars tend to argue over which bit of recovered war history was most significant. Many side with the Idols - the lifelike, seemingly lucid and sentient engines of war employed by ancient states to do battle. Not many of these were left intact, and most of the ones that were appeared non-functional, sometimes even screaming for the release of death, to the alarm of archaeologists.

Those Idols who were able to make a full recovery were instrumental in the early days of Man's resurgence, essentially kick-starting technology by instructing them how to use simple machines to automate tasks such as sawing logs, or hammering at the forge.
