## The City of Brillante
Capital of the State of Brillante, in respect.

The Gorgon Desert was once the ancestral home of the Carven, and those outcasts who clung to their culture. Several centuries after Mankind had dredged itself from its own ashes, the Gemrule Tribe, a predominantly Human nation, waged a bloody and selfish war at the Jaw of the Desert, one of the most sacred Carven religious sites. This particular location would be fought over for decades, leaving Gemrule Tribe as a footnote in history, and passing control of the territory from hand to hand.

No one really knows when the perpetual warzone began to become a city, but what is known is that centuries after the first sandstone brick had been laid, control of Brillante settled into one set of hands: those of the Saint Iris Tribe.

 * The definition of the City changes depending on who you ask. Objectively, the City's boundaries coincide with those of the Jaw (see below). Outerlying regions, neighborhoods, townships, or other areas are considered its territories.

 * 'Brillante' is a term interchangeable between City and State - the State is a far larger entity, spanning several thousand square kilometers of territory, and numerous claimed islands.

## The Jaw
Naming conventions all across Ninesilver tend to reflect flights of fancy; in this case, it couldn't be more literal. The Jaw refers to the immense, calcified extrusions that surround the City of Brillante, nestling the urban space in a protective ring of rocklike adamant. Viewed from afar, it looks like nothing so much as a monster having died in the attempt to swallow the city whole, with its spiked lower teeth sunken beneath the coast, drawing in tremendous amounts of seawater.

 * The "teeth" of the Jaw are spires of mysterious stone, as big as a city block, that jut from the earth. These are thoroughly encrusted in veins of gemstone.

 * Attempts to break or chip away at the Jaw have proven fruitless throughout history. Even with rapidly increasing technology, no one has been able to produce more than whiffs of faint dust from the "teeth". The gems are impossible to remove, though by some slow erosion process, tumblings of stonestuff and gemstuff plummet from each tooth from time to time. Needless to say this material is preposterously valuable, and usually ends up in the troves of nobility.

## The Tidal Steps
A tremendous staircase, referred to as "wide enough for eight ox-carts abreast." It begins at the edge of a tall, seaside cliff on the northernmost regions of Langley Green and plummets several hundred feet into the Kono Brightside Sea. At its base is nothing, just the depths of the sea. The uselessness of its construction is an intended part of the structure's purpose, and the subject of much furious debate amongst architectural students and scholars. It remains, to date, the only successful manmade attempt to spawn a God.

 * Though the Brightside Sea was lower in the pre-war days, during the final phases of construction, it was necessary for slaves to dive beneath sea level to lay bricks. Almost all of these slaves drowned in the course of their work, and were buried inside the staircase.

 * The Steps are made of a stone mysterious to current scholars and archaeologists: smooth and polished like metal, absurdly strong, and capable of absorbing lots of heat, yet comparatively lightweight. The reinforcing bars of steel built into the stones were an instrumental architectural discovery to modern-day civilization.
