## How Abilities Work
Abilities are the primary way by which you interact with the world in Blackbirds. Though certain core commands exist for all characters (USE, PUNCH, KICK, DESCRIBE, to name a few), these abilities represent the particular strengths and disciplines your character excels at.

Much in the same way rooms represent abstract notions of space, abilities represent abstract capabilities. Abilities can range from the physical and mundane (lifting heavy objects, running fast), to the exotic (shooting energy from a staff, debugging old Fae Age machinery), to the cultural (weaving a flower garland, drawing the names of your foes in blood).

## Abilities, Ability Trees, and Hidden Ability Trees

### Abilities
Each ability has three levels, each of which confer various benefits. The AP cost of each ability will increase based on level - 1 at level 1, 3 at level 2, and 5 at level 3. Even though not all abilities can have the same *cool factor*, leveling each ability should feel like a good and rewarding choice.

For instance, the Strength ability may look something like this:
```
STRENGTH
A measure of your character's sheer brawn. You can hit harder and last longer than others.

    Lv 1: Grants use of the GUTPUNCH command.
          Grants use of the SMASH command.
          You can smash certain flimsy objects.
          You do more damage with melee attacks.

    Lv 2: Grants use of the GRAPPLE command.
          Grants use of the KNOCKOUT command.
          You can smash windows and weak doors.
          You do much more damage with melee attacks.

    Lv 3: Grants use of the CLOTHESLINE command.
          You can smash through strong doors, weak locks, and weak walls.
          You do considerable damage with melee attacks.
```

### Ability Trees
Each ability belongs to an ability tree. Ability trees themselves grant benefits, much the same way abilities do, but are not leveled up directly - rather, their level is the combined total level of all abilities in the tree. The benefits of ability trees tend to be more granular, though they can often be powerful additions to your arsenal.

Unlike regular abilities, ability trees have a maximum level of nine (pending balance adjustments). Once that maximum level is reached, you can no longer spend AP on any abilities in that tree.

In the example above, we looked at the Strength ability. The Strength ability belongs to the Physical Prowess tree, which looks like this:
```
  ||||_____ PHYSICAL PROWESS
          3 Strength
          0 Endurance
          1 Speed

PHYSICAL PROWESS
You are greater than the sum of your parts. Through careful honing and conditioning of your body, and through considerable discipline, you become capable of incredible things.

    Lv 1: You no longer become tired from certain mundane tasks.

    Lv 3: You gain slightly increased Endurance regeneration.

    Lv 5: Grants use of the NAP command.
          You have learned to carefully regulate yourself, and can nap once a
          day, getting a full day's sleep in only a few minutes.

          For each level in Physical Prowess, you can carry +60 kg of weight in
          items and equipment.

```

### Hidden Ability Trees
The most important feature of ability trees is that they are used to unlock *hidden* ability trees! Hidden ability trees have certain ability and ability tree level costs, and will reveal themselves in your ability list when you've met their requirements. For instance, the Blacksmithing tree requires Fabrication (tree) of 5, and Metalworking (ability) of 3.
```
  |||||____ FABRICATION
          3 Blacksmithing
          0 Glassblowing
          2 Clothcrafting
          0 Bonecarving

  _________ BLACKSMITHING
          ? ????
          ? ????
          ? ????
          ? ????
          ? ????
```
Because Metalworking is in the Fabrication ability tree, this means you must level Metalworking three times, then invest 2 AP into other Fabrication abilities, at which point Blacksmithing is unlocked. Because these hidden ability trees require an investment into one or more narrower fields of development, they represent "specializations" in various skills. Anyone in Blackbirds can crap out a suit of armor - but it takes the touch of a Blacksmith to create something that'll really save your hide in battle.

Rumor has it these trees can even be unlocked by reaching certain amounts of wealth, or by uncovering certain items...

## Progression
Abilities in Blackbirds cost Ability Points (AP). Characters earn AP every time they reach a certain threshold of experience, at which point their XP counter resets and they are credited +1 AP. For each four points of AP you earn on one character, you also earn one account-based AP, which can be spent on new characters while still in character generation (note to self: still in concept stage. Better idea may be allowing players to buy AP with Rubric in chargen).

### Throttling/Regulation of Progression
Because abilities directly correlate to the power of a character, certain measures are taken to either slow down the rate at which a character can grow, or to halt them in a certain direction entirely.

**How strong can a character get?**
- Although there are certain limitations on which abilities you can mix and match (see below), there is no true upper limit to how much AP a character can accumulate. The current plan calls for the required XP per point of AP to climb drastically every ten AP - to a point that around the fifties, it will become quite slow.

- This is deliberate - a very old and very established character, especially one who has been roleplaying almost constantly during their lifetime, can and *should* be markedly more powerful than most characters. But it's going to take them a while.

- As stated above, a special "account-based" AP is earned, at a much slower rate than regular AP. This small boost allows your next character to catch up slightly - you don't have to start as a peasant, squabbling in the mud, every single time.

**What stops you from dumping all of your points into every skill you have?**
- Each ability has a maximum level of 3 (with very few exceptions).

- However, each ability tree itself has a maximum level of 9, at which point you can no longer spend AP on any ability in the tree. This means you can max out only three abilities, or choose to spread out your AP a little more evenly.

- As all hidden ability trees require at least one ability to be fully upgraded to Level 3, this means you have to make careful choices as to how to distribute your AP.

**What if you make a mistake and spent your points on the wrong ability? What if you change your mind?**
- It is possible to unlearn an ability, though you're refunded only half of the ability's cost, rounded down (Lv 3: 2, Lv 2: 1, Lv 1: 0).

- If the ability you're attempting to unlearn is a prerequisite for an unlocked hidden ability tree, you cannot unlearn it until you've unlearned every ability in that tree.

- This becomes incredibly undesirable to do at much higher AP levels, as you will take longer and longer to earn AP, so choose carefully!
