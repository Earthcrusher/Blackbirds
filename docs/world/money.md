# Money

## On the radio
Technology all across most of Ninesilver is a bit of a mess - a bunch of cavemen were taught half-remembered physics from robots who mostly specialized in shooting machine guns. One scientific field they've managed to pin down, however, is the study of radio waves.

In Blackbirds, radio technology is a fantasized pseudoscience that doesn't necessarily reflect real-world application, but should look a little familiar. It's used to disseminate state propaganda as far as they can build the towers. The rich use RF keys in place of regular metal ones to get into their homes. Rich people *and* commoners enjoy the miraculous ability to send short messages to one another over the air with ubiquitous communication gizmos. And if you happen to be a citizen of the most powerful city-state in the world, radio waves have even taken the place of your money.

## Amplitude
The currency of Brillante and its outerlying regions is Amplitude. Amplitude or amps, are measured in dB, and are stored on a money chit.

Money chits are small, metallic, coin-like devices, with a low-res screen displaying a soundwave. Every citizen is given one of these chits, and can be re-issued one at a central office should it be lost or stolen. Typically their exact value is read with certain common appliances, found in stores, banks, and other institutions. You can tell roughly how many amps are stored on a chit by looking at the soundwave, which will grow large and frantic with accumulated money.

### The effects of Amplitude on business and culture
The decision to move to radio-based money was initially not a popular one. Business owners struggled to afford the equipment needed to process transactions. Most people found the entire paradigm confusing. Chits were constantly getting misplaced. Malicious actors discovered ways to interfere with the Amplitude of the tokens, and give themselves absurd amounts of money.

The state's initial foray into Amplitude was a disaster. The ensuing recall and various logistical issues around that time represented what was arguably Brillante's worst financial nightmare. It was not until six years later that the government issued a new and improved version of the money chits.

The new tokens were a massive security success. The precise means by which amps are authenticated was a closely-guarded state secret, but the process was widely understood as requiring all transactions to run through a central counting house of sorts, where the precise Amplitude was compared against past transactions and other spending trends. The era of money counterfeiting was declared officially over.

This time, businesses and other institutions in key sectors were given state grants, affording them Amp-reading appliances for free, with the caveat that they had to go completely cashless within a year. Almost all of them made the switch. Those who didn't continued to dabble in increasingly rare physical money, and even today a few converted businesses are known to take cash under the table.

### Talking money
Amplitude transformed the language of money. Well-to-do people and the upper crust were referred to as *noisy*. They had *loud money*. Previously, someone would have asked to see your money. Now they ask to *hear* it. Amongst the unlearned classes, superstitions abounded about sounds and musical notes that were thought to be especially pleasing, and encourage the accumulation of wealth. Entire musical disciplines sprung from thin air, centering around transacteurs and their strings of fortune.
