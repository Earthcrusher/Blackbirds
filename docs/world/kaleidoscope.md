## The Kaleidoscope
The Kaleidoscope is the name given to the sky, and all beyond it. The word "sky" remains in use to describe Ninesilver's atmosphere. You would say that a bird flies through the sky, but that the moon passes through the Kaleidoscope.

### Kaleidoscopic Objects
Kaleidoscopic Objects are essentially heavenly bodies, and refer to any object seen consistently in the sky.

Objects fall under one of three designations: familial, which describes objects in Ninesilver's atmosphere; suspended, which describes exoatmospheric objects which retain their position; all others fall under no particular classification, and either orbit Ninesilver, or are quite distant and not considered part of the world itself, such as the moon.

#### The Delight
**Classification:** Sun

The Delight, known archaically as the "Gildelight," which itself is a mutation of "Gilded Light." Refers to the star around which Ninesilver orbits; it also refers to the beautiful filigreed metal cage that surrounds the body.

The names given to parts of the Delight's cage, especially those portions of it that appear to be damaged or eroded, vary from region to region. What is agreed upon is that no one quite understands why it is there, or what it's for.

#### The Moon
**Classification:** Moon

By some freak chance of memetic linguistics, the term "moon" has survived well into modern parlance, and refers unsurprisingly to the luminous moon in the night sky. The moon above Ninesilver is distinctive not only for its many crystalline features, but for the deep and jagged scars that pepper its surface.

#### Khopesh
**Classification:** Suspended, Satellite

Sometimes referred to as the Spider. Khopesh is classified as a "suspended" Kaleidoscopic Object, meaning it hangs at a fixed point in the sky. It is distinctive for its eight depending rectangular arms (spider legs), and the medley of blinking red and white lights on its underbelly.

#### Belsamel
**Classification:** Satellite

Described in folklore as being Khopesh's wandering sister. Belsamel is a spherical Object that circumnavigates the Kaleidoscope, quite close to Ninesilver's atmosphere. It is without lights or interesting extraneous features, but is noteworthy for the grid of dark blue panels that cover its surface.

#### Old Nightmare Eyes
**Classification:** Suspended, Satellite

A sinister-looking suspended Kaleidoscopic Object. Old children's tales warn about being seen by Old Nightmare Eyes, and refer to the enormous red lens hung from the "face" of the strange structure.

#### The Axe House
**Classification:** Familial, Structure

A palatial structure of unknown origin, flying by unknown means through the air, several kilometers off of Brillante Coast. The building's Fae Age origins are undisputable, and is thought of as either a civic structure or the former home of royalty. Prevailing public theory suggests it is the residence of the Blackbirds, though this cannot be confirmed.
