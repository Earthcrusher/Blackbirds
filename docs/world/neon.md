## Neon
A byproduct of unprecedented global violence. **Something** happened at the end of the War of Gorgons that rendered Ninesilver nearly uninhabitable. When Mankind emerged from its various warrens to survey the damage, they found Neon.

### The Treasure of Treasures
Neon is a mysterious luminous presence, comprising its own state of matter. It is similar enough to a gas that it can be harvested with specialized machinery, but exposure to the skin is damaging, and one breath of it can prove fatal to most people. Neon does not appear to be rooted in the typical laws of space or time, but study of this subject is outlawed, except by lead researchers of Brillante with the highest levels of clearance.

To describe it using real-world analogues, it's a sort of mystical radiation, but one that you can see.

Long before the events of the game, most of the continent's Neon reserves were gobbled up by disparate groups of explorers, bounty hunters, and scientists. We now know that these became the Blackbirds. What remains of the world's Neon supply is Catoblepas, the treacherous and forbidden region of the Gorgon Desert, where a vast "Neon ocean" is guarded jealously by the State of Brillante.

### Neon in Use
Named an "occult energy" by the scientific community, Neon's most common use is in the production of hexcraft batteries, vessels in which the substance is safely contained, and that interfaces with a hexer's personal forces in wild and dramatic ways. The manufacture of these batteries is a closely-guarded State secret, and the Saint Iris Tribe enjoys direct control over supply and demand.

Efforts have been made to leverage Neon as a power source, but owing to its unpredictable effects on spacetime, all attempts to somehow integrate it into a workable engine concept have met with disaster.

### Neon in Culture
A favorite property of Neon is arguably its most wasteful and useless: when introduced to an electrical current, it glows like ghostly fire, but slowly disintegrates in the process. In today's culture, the wealthiest merchants, and almost all State-funded churches, use Neon lighting as a show of extravagance and power.
