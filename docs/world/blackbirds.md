## The Blackbirds
Pedants, pessimists, and penitents will tell you that Tribal rule is a farce. They'll tell you that it's in the Axe House, or the Satellites, or that castle that's supposed to be under the ocean, that the Blackbirds rule the world.

As far as shadowy ruling classes go, they're not half bad. Much like the gods, they really don't seem to care enough to meddle in mundane affairs. However, there is the stabbing problem.

### The Stabbing Problem
We're not really sure what to do about it. It's not all the time. It's not like we're afraid to leave our houses because of the stabbing problem. It's just that it *is* a problem.

Consider this: in this day and age, our Queen is Rainy Saint Iris. She's not bad as far as Queens go, which is to say she's still a warmongering hypercapitalist piece of shit, but hey, the last Queen was stripping people naked in the streets and killing them, so we're counting our blessing here.

Since her tenure, oh... eight, nine years ago, Rainy has declared war on three nations, racked up a body count approaching the million mark, and was personally present for the plundering and subsequent destruction of the oldest temple in Feathermore. The Blackbirds have been totally fine with this. Just completely content, not so much as a flutter of window drapes or the sound of a cloak flapping.

But the last Queen? Michelo? One day, old Michelo heads down to her consultation room, the one with all the star charts, the weird occult place. Next thing you know, she's staggering back up the steps, gagging and gasping for breath, and some beautiful rail-thin pale bastard's got his knife stuck right in her spine. Snap, just like that! Gone without a trace. Rest in shit, Queen Michelo. Hope it hurt the entire time.

So yeah, they're not half bad. But sometimes, they show up and stab you. Why you? When? Fuck if we know.

### O Caliginous Gorgeosity
We know they used to be people. Hell, we know who most of them were. They were the first Lucky Fuckers. There was the Neon Drive, and they got there first, and the fastest, and maybe they even killed people so they'd get more. But once they got that Neon, they stopped being people and they started being Blackbirds.

I'm a pretty lucky man; I'm only fifty years old, but I've seen three of them.

Seiklus is the big one, the man with the bear hands. We think he used to be a Sacrilite, but that's the funny thing about being a Blackbird. You're more a Blackbird than whatever you were before. He's got the fur and the long ears, but he looks just like the rest of them - bright white skin, like a column of ashes. Black hair. Black eyes. And toes to throat he's in that black spook suit. I saw Seiklus back when I was a boy, riding with my dad while he guided convoys down the Jugular River. One cart goes wheeling and crashes into the water. Out of the river comes the guy, big as hell, that weird knife of his still dripping blood. Leaves behind splintered wagon wood, and something purple spreading through the water. We don't know what the driver was carrying, but he never carried it again. Seiklus was gone before the first bolts left their crossbows.

I saw my next when I was barely a man, not even a beard on my face yet. That was Nail. Nail was one mean-looking bitch. Probably my favorite. I'll never forget that night at the theater. We were there to see *Mercy, My Queen*, put on by the Waveshaper Players. I can remember the *noise* the crowd made, before they stopped making noise. A hundred people all gasping at the same time, then going quiet. This woman walked right out of a quickstone wall, the way you or I would go through a curtain. Same story, same look: the white-white-white skin, the all-black everything. Her arms and legs too long, all stretched out. Her guy was Sundy Mulverin, the actor playing the Carven shaman. Walked right up to him while he was reciting his hex, click-click on the stage, and stuck a knife right between his eyes. And then she was gone.

No one believes me, but I saw Everlong, too. Everlong, the one they all say's the "leader". That's a load of shit. They don't do leaders. They don't work like that. I didn't see Everlong do the deed. I wasn't in the palace at the time, I was working in the yard. But I heard the scream, and I saw him jump out the window, passing right through the glass like it wasn't there. They think he's the leader because his weapon's different. He's got that sword, the one you can't get a fix on. That's how I know it was him.

Like I told you, I'm a lucky guy. Most people go their whole lives without seeing the Blackbirds. Me, I saw three.

### The Assassinocracy
It's not that they really rule us. We know where they live. We can't get to them, but we've seen the places where they go, blinking in and out like strange black fireflies. Who of us hasn't stood on the shore and called them dogshit cowards, a bunch of meddling fucks, lowlives? You might as well scream at the moon. Hell, I've done that, too.

It's easy to pin our problems on them. Don't they come down, take who they want? Don't they remove people they don't like? If we're being honest, we don't really know. We don't know why they do what they do. We don't know the first thing about 'em. No one's ever talked to a Blackbird. It's not that they don't talk, it's that they're not people you talk to.

Maybe a few of us pray to them. I did, once or twice. Just long enough before I thought about how stupid it was. They'll never really show up when you need them; they don't work that way. People get crushed under the bootheels all the time. Plenty of people getting robbed. Getting raped. Blackbirds don't care. Queen Rainy, gods fuck her soul, can round up whole villages without getting the knife. Blackbirds don't care.

You ask me, I think they're a force. They're not much different from hurricanes. From floods. Not much different from a collapsing roof, or a horse kicking you in the teeth. Maybe it's because they look like us, used to be us, we think we can assign our rules to them.

The truth is, it's easier than admitting that maybe we suffer for no reason.
