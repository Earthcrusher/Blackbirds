# Gods

## **JOURNEY:** Spinner, the Vagabond-King

### The Walking God, The Road More Traveled, The Secret and Profane

- **Appearance:** Appears either as a very dark and misshapen old man, with a beardlike growth extruding from 'his' face, and a green cloak that melds seamlessly with his flesh - like the god is emulating a woodland traveler. Otherwise, he presents as a clutch of evergreen trees, capped with snow. His 'human' form has ragged boots with no soles.
- **Origin:** Was spawned when Man laid the first highway.
- **Powers:** Spatial distortion, finding food, impossibly good but short-lived stealth.

## **EMPIRE:** ????

### ????

- **Appearance:** ????
- **Origin:** Spawned when EMPIRE grew to be the largest single nation in world history.
- **Powers:** Group-based buffs, themes of entropy, cold, and hidden heat.

## **NEON:** Bleed-the-Sky

### The Violent Stars, The Man in the Mirror, Falsehead

- **Appearance:** Straight-up horror god; no fixed appearance, can only be seen by the distortions it creates in reality. Lights pulse and burn intensely when it's in the area. Neon fixtures go black, and Neon-powered devices stop working completely - often with disastrous results.
- **Origin:** Spawned from the Neon Rush - Man working together to harvest and refine the unpredictable substance.
- **Powers:** Wild magic, death-threatening masochistic rituals, unpredictable and often widely damaging effects.

## **THEOGENESIS:** ????

### (????)

- **Appearance:** ????
- **Origin:** The first-ever recorded instance of Man attempting to spawn a God. Spawned from the construction of the Tidal Steps, the ages-old staircase plummeting from a lofty seaside cliff into the Kono Brightside Sea. It was intended to exist as a sort of architectural god, supporting the wealth and power of a now-dead kingdom, but instead thrives on cruelty and malice.
- **Powers:** ????

## **DESERT:** ????

### (????)

- **Appearance:** ????
- **Origin:** Spawned in the aftermath of a starving desert tribe beseeching "someone" for aid. Rather than feed the tribe, it sucked them bone-dry, killing every last one of them.
- **Powers:** Feeding (passive room-based energy succing, a la Haven)

## **WAR:** ????

### (????)

- **Appearance:** ????
- **Origin:** Spawned during the War of Gorgons.
- **Powers:** ????

## **GLUTTONY:** Grottle

### All-Eater, Mother/Father Vast, The Transcendent Belly

- **Appearance:** A great chasm in the nearest wall, floor, or ceiling, ringed with bulbous, fleshy lips and immense shark's teeth. It is one of the few gods that can speak in a sensible tongue, but has a thick accent.
- **Origin:** ???? predates the Fae Age. The ritual from which it spawned is not well understood, but is generally agreed to be a massive-scale cannibalistic sacrifice.
- **Powers:** Regenerates its worshippers' endurance levels, but requires the sacrifice of lots and lots of food.
