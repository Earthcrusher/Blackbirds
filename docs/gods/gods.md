# Gods

## What Gods Are

There are "gods" and gods. Mankind has often sought out the succor and warmth of "gods", but they are a wholly manmade invention and they don't answer prayers. Gods, on the other hand, are different.

In scholarly circles it is considered proper to refer to them as God Creatures, or sometimes God Beasts. This term passed into use around the time Brillante passed into the hands of the Saint Iris Tribe; use of the term is one of many tells of a noble, learned, or moneyed person. Gods are born, or "spawned," based on certain poorly understood factors, usually involving a lot of people doing the same thing all at once. What exactly is known about the gods can fit on a few sheets of paper.

What is known:

 * The gods come and go - they spawn abruptly, they appear intermittently, and they vanish without a trace or warning.
 * They come in varying levels of "sentience", though this is criticized as a humanoid-centric way of thinking.
 * There is an apparent correlation between sentience and age.
 * Most gods don't last long enough to exhibit any more intelligence or agency than the average dog.
 * The gods can learn our languages, but it seems to take hundreds, if not thousands, of years.
 * Gods frequently take "humanoid" forms, adopting shapes that hold up from afar, but appear disturbing and misshapen up close, missing facial features or with improperly formed limbs.
 * The gods can move about or appear at will, either inhumanly quick, or simply not beholden to the laws of physics.
 * They have "aspects", certain things that they feed from. These are interpreted as ways to please the god.
 * Pleasing a god usually incurs a "reward". It is this behavior that led to their being referred to as gods.

What is not known:

 * How they spawn.
 * Where they are from.
 * Why some gods die off quickly, and some seem to be immortal.
 * Why they are interested in us.
 * Why they take on our forms.
 * And lots more.

## On Gender and Pronoun Use

A god is sometimes referred to as 'he' or 'she' or a specific other pronoun. These are never determined by the gods themselves - even the ones who can grasp the concept of gender are largely indifferent to it. Often the pronouns pass into common use when a god takes on a humanoid shape. It's important not to misgender people, but the gods won't really care!

## **JOURNEY:** Spinner

### The Walking Steady, The Road More Traveled, The Secret and Profane

- **Appearance:** Appears as a very dark and misshapen old man, with a beardlike growth extruding from 'his' face, and a green cloak that melds seamlessly with his flesh - like the god is emulating a woodland traveler. Otherwise, he presents as a clutch of evergreen trees, capped with snow, regardless of which environment he appears in. His 'human' form has ragged boots with no soles.
- **Synopsis:** Was spawned when Man laid the first highway.

## **NEON:** Eidophusikon

### The Violent Stars, The Thing in the Mirror, Falsehead

- **Appearance:** Glitches in spacetime. Glimpses of something wrong; a mirror projecting blue light or furniture moved where it wasn't before. Appallingly loud static distortion. In its nigh-invisible presence, Neon fixtures and Neon-powered devices stop working, often with disastrous results if no failsafes were built in.
- **Synopsis:** Introduced to this world when Neon welled uncontrollably from Catoblepas. Scholars of god Creatures disagree on its true nature, claiming it isn't a god at all, but something that may as well be. Given that gods in and of themselves are a poorly understood subject, this distinction isn't considered significant.

## **THEOGENESIS:** Needless

### The Ocean in Pain, The Forced March, Mr./Ms. Brightside

- **Appearance:** Needless takes on the distorted shape of countless nude men and women with hunched backs, their limbs locked and melded together like melted tallow. Sometimes, it manifests itself as a descent where one should not be - in an otherwise featureless wall, or even in the boughs of a tree.
- **Synopsis:** The first-ever recorded instance of Man attempting to spawn a god. Birthed from the construction of the Tidal Steps, the ages-old staircase plummeting from a lofty seaside cliff into the Kono Brightside Sea. It was intended to exist as a sort of architectural god, supporting the wealth and power of a now-dead kingdom, but instead thrives on cruelty and malice.

## **WAR:** The Stain

### Our Mother of Sorrow, Endhearth

- **Appearance:** A sinewy, Humanlike being with splotchy red flesh, and a tremendous mass of "hair" that depends in blades. Sometimes makes her presence known as the throaty and lustful cries of an impossibly vast warhost.
- **Synopsis:** The first time a group of people acted on the urges to exterminate another, the Stain was there - far before the Fae Age, or the Ages before that. As one of the oldest gods, she displays considerable sentience, and presents a sorrowful and regretful demeanor. She is known to appear in war chambers and briefing rooms, weeping without sound as generals argue strategy. The generals cannot see her, but the men they send to their deaths can.

## **GLUTTONY:** Grottle

### All-Eater, Mother/Father Vast, The Transcendent Belly

- **Appearance:** A great chasm in the nearest wall, floor, or ceiling, ringed with bulbous, fleshy lips and immense shark's teeth. It is one of the few gods that can speak in a sensible tongue, but has a thick accent.
- **Synopsis:** Grottle is one of the oldest gods, predating the Fae Age. The ritual from which it spawned is not well understood, but is generally agreed to be a massive-scale cannibalistic sacrifice. It acts as a sort of agent of consumption, seemingly pleased by gluttony and waste.
