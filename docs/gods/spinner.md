## Spinner, the Vagabond-King
- **Favors:** Travelers, wayfarers, mercenaries, pickpockets
- **Realms:** Mountain roads, valleys, riverside trails

### Synopsis
Before venturing on a long journey, give prayer to Spinner. Finding the lands of the Creators wanting, he marched over dells, glades, and valleys, leaving roads both public and secret in the wake of his ragged boots. For this, he is thought of as scorned by the Almighty Ones.

### Offerings, Favors
Spinner is pleased by givings of nuts, by foreign coins, and of metals spun into thin fabric. He is known to strongly bless those who sacrifice their favorite knives and compasses - they always find their way without fear of getting lost. He despises tax collectors, and hunters who kill for sport. Spinner is also a capricious soul who can be relied upon to hide the miserable and downtrodden from the eyes of local lawmen; for this, most thieves tend to whisper their prayers to the Vagabond-King.

### Shrines
Spinner is not often honored with shrines, owing to his nomadic and mercurial nature. Occasionally a wayshrine will bear his name carved into wood, with a number of old coins scattered at his base. Other times, road markers and signs will appear festooned with bead necklaces given to him in praise. Spinner's favorite shrine is the Mercado Bridge, the tradesman's span which joins the West-Facing and East-Facing Crags, into whose timbers are etched the King's songs.

### Appearance
Mortals catch glimpses from time to time of Spinner in physical form. They often recall an old and tremendous man of hearty disposition, tending to grin endlessly beneath a tremendous white beard, and draped in ranger's greens and a massive cloak.

His true form is a clutch of evergreen trees, each joined at the base by a root system that is covered in jewels.
