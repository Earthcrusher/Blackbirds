# Core Functionality

## Behind the Scenes

### Display Features

- [ ] Override all use of msg() with proprietary method - implementation TBD.
   - "echo" class, defining all ways to display messages to players (read: unidirectional, room, gamewide, etc.)
   - Just make a bunch of functions. Not Python friendly!

- [ ] Standardize prompt, ensure it displays after literally everything.

- [ ] GMCP! But let's not be in a rush.

## Creation

### Characters

- [ ] Need to implement at least a basic chargen and determine what properties a character has.
   - [ ] **Big Decision**: Haven-style descriptions, with body parts, etc.?
      - [ ] Fields for each body part (lower face, stomach, groin, etc.).
      - [ ] Ability to describe each, freely and on the fly.
   - [ ] No coded sex/gender (sorry, chuds).
      - [ ] Pronouns. As much as I'd love to make them freeform, for grammatical purposes, limited to he/she/they.
      - [ ] Detector in our echo class that looks for verbs after "they" pronouns and depluralizes them.
      - [ ] Specify body parts, such as breasts, that might appear in a slot-based description system.
      - [ ] HIGHLY doubt it will ever be a thing, but specify: can get pregnant?
   - [ ] Race. Choices pending establishment of setting. Tempted to go full human.
   - [ ] Background - poverty, child of politician, that sort of thing.

- [ ] Make a nice little tour for them to get acquainted.

### Rooms

- [ ] Implement IRE-style building. yeah lmao it won't be that easy

- [ ] Determine what properties rooms need. Obvious ones: Environment, area, indoors/outdoors, water, etc.

# Setting

## General

High fantasy with anachronistic modern touches; the world Aetolia tried to be but couldn't. Think *Romeo + Juliet*, 2018's *Robin Hood*, or *Final Fantasy XV*.

### Culture

* Officially, language is formal and archaic:
     Standing atop the dead, Ashlar ejects the clip from his weapon, the blade smoking in his tightly-gripped fist. "Behold, the way of things," he announces to the assembly.

     "You call this money?" The trader asks, biting at the coin's edge. "You insult me with this trifle - but I tell you plainly, I would derive a full MONEY's worth of pleasure from placing this dog-eared pig iron into the weaver's palm. I'll take it!"

### Clothing Conventions

* **Formalwear:** Modern suits, fine dresses with contemporary cuts, but all with a baroque and ornate twist. The elite tend to wear an absolute shitload of jewelry, draped over everything, such that they jingle when they walk.

* **Armor:** Full-on high fantasy. Field plate, sabatons, greaves, the works. Politicians wear ringmail beneath their suits to fend away assassin's blades. Even peasants might own a nice leather jerkin.

* **Other anachronisms:** Aetolia-style: Kimonos, certain bits of lingerie (thongs, teddies, etc.). *Hard no* on trenchcoats, fedoras, or any other neckbeard crap.

### Specific Cool Things

* Hospitaliers in full regalia and armor standing sentinel over a chapel soaked in neon lights.

* Radio towers dotting the landscape, looking over towers, fortresses, and hamlets, spreading state propaganda.

* "Neon Mode": Name pending - some kind of otherworldly space. Mid-level players can move through it and it's the basis by which all stealth takes place. High-level players can even see into it from our plane.
