# Core Functionality

## Behind the Scenes

### Display Features

* Override all use of msg() with proprietary method - implementation TBD.
   - "echo" class, defining all ways to display messages to players (read: unidirectional, room, gamewide, etc.)
   - Just make a bunch of functions. Not Python friendly!

* Standardize prompt, ensure it displays after literally everything.

* GMCP! But let's not be in a rush.

## Creation

### Characters

* Need to implement at least a basic chargen and determine what properties a character has.
   - Obvious: First and last name, sex/gender, pronouns, race, hair/eyes, etc.

* Make a nice little tour for them to get acquainted.

### Rooms

[ ] Implement IRE-style building. yeah lmao it won't be that easy

[ ] Determine what properties rooms need. Obvious ones: Environment, area, indoors/outdoors, water, etc.
