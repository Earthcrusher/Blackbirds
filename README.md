# Blackbirds

A multiplayer text RPG by Earthcrusher (Brendon Hollesen).

## What is Blackbirds?

Blackbirds is a synthwave fantasy RPI MUD, an unholy marriage of high-tech 1980s kitsch with swords and sorcery. It's Patrick Nagel meets Gary Gygax. Taking place in the post-post-apocalyptic world of Ninesilver, players vie for control over Brillante, the crucible of modern civilization. It may not make complete sense unless you're a little genre savvy, but rest assured the setting is as unique as can be.
