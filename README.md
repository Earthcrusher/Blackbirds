# Blackbirds

An Evennia MUD project by Earthcrusher.

## What is Blackbirds?

Blackbirds is a multiplayer text RPG running on the [Evennia engine](http://www.evennia.com/), implemented in Python.

Players roleplay with one another in a quasi-medieval, high fantasy world that strangely resembles our own. For more information check out the [Design Document](https://github.com/Earthcrusher/Blackbirds/blob/dev/Design%20Document.md).
